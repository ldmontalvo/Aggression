Intra- and Interspecific Territorial Aggression Across a Precipitation Gradient in Campylorhynchus

This ongoing study examines territorial aggression within and between Campylorhynchus species distributed along a precipitation gradient in western Ecuador. We quantified intra- and interspecific aggression through territorial playback experiments with C. z. brevirostris, C. fasciatus, and their genetically admixed populations. The first goal was to compare aggression levels between parental species and hybrid populations. The second goal was to test for associations between territorial aggression and spatial climate variability along the precipitation gradient. The next phase of this study will integrate behavioral data with genomic and environmental analyses. This will allow us to elucidate the multi-factorial drivers shaping territorial interactions and aggression across environmental gradients.
